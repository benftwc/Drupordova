Drupordova
==========

This Drupal Module allow you to connect and retrieve nodes from your website to an Apache Cordova App.

You could use this Cordova Library without any Drupal tech, you just have to query a webservice (POST / GET) and get an XML/JSON output directly on the device.

Designed for JS developpers and Drupal administrators / contributors.
